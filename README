How to use
==========

Populate directory with markdown files (they have to end with .markdown). You
can also create arbitrarily nested subdirectories containing .markdown files.

Sg will go recursively through all directories not beginning with an underscore
("_") and convert the .markdown files into .html. The resulting HTML files will
be saved into the _site directory, conserving the directory structure where the
.markdown file was found.

Put your static content into _static. Files and subdirectories will be copied
into _site without any modifications.

TODO
====

  * document the YAML frontmatter
  * create _dirs if not found and provide a primitive template
  * enable layout selection by _layout_foo or so
